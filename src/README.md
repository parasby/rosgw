# ROSGW

ROSGW is a software agent to connect ROS components and others(REST, different subnet, etc.). It is inspired by [ros2-web-bridge](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/ros2-web-bridge)

## Features

  * Support rosbridge v2 protocol
  * Support ROS Service relay
  * Support ROS Action relay 
  * Configure Publish/Subscribe/Service/Action bridge function in runtime
  * Support ROS to REST API configuration in runtime

## Install and Run

### Run under Docker

1. Clone and make docker container
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/lge-cloud-ai-robot/rosgw.git
  $ cd rosgw
  $ docker build --rm -t ros2gw .
  ```
2. Run the gateway container
  ```bash
  $ docker run --name ros2gw_1 --rm -d -p 9000:9000 ros2gw
  ```
3. Check the gatway working

- Open http://localhost:9000/docs with a web browser


## Configure relay configuration

### ADD Topic Publish API

The ADD Topic Publish API configures the gateway to forward the topic to the target gateway set by address.

The API URL is 'http://localhost:9000/gateway/publisher/add'.

An example JSON request is as follows :

```json
{
  "address": "ws://targethost:3030",
  "publish": [
    {
      "name": "/my_topic",
      "type": "std_msgs/msg/String",
      "compression": "cbor-raw"
    }
  ]
}
```
* address - the target gateway address to receive the specified topic.
* publish - an array of the topic configuration to send to the target
* publish.name - the topic name to send to the target
* publish.type - the topic type to send to the target
* publish.compression - compression method : "cbor-raw", "cbor", "none"

### ADD Topic Subscribe API

The ADD Topic Subscribe API configures the gateway to pull the topic from the target gateway set by address.

The API URL is 'http://localhost:9000/gateway/subscriber/add'.

An example JSON request is as follows :

```json
{
  "address": "ws://targethost:3030",
  "subscribe": [
    {
      "name": "/my_topic",
      "type": "std_msgs/msg/String",
      "compression": "cbor-raw"      
    }
  ]
}
```
* address - the target gateway address to request to send the specified topic .
* subscribe - an array of the topic configuration to receive from the target
* subscribe.name - the topic name to receive from the target
* subscribe.type - the topic type to receive from the target
* subscribe.compression - compression method : "cbor-raw", "cbor", "none"


### ADD Service Expose API

The ADD Service Expose API configures the gateway to receive the ROS service request from the target gateway set by address.

The API URL is 'http://localhost:9000/gateway/service/expose'.

An example JSON request is as follows :

```json
{
  "address": "ws://localhost:9001",
  "service": [
    {
      "service": "add_two_ints",
      "type": "srv_tester_if.srv.AddTwoInts"
    }
  ]
}
```
* address - the target gateway address to be allowed for the ROS service request
* service - an array of the service configuration to be exposed to the target
* service.service - the service name to be exposed to the target
* service.type - the service type to be exposed to the target

### ADD Action Expose API

The ADD Action Expose API configures the gateway to receive the ROS Action request from the target gateway set by address.

The API URL is 'http://localhost:9000/gateway/action/expose'.

An example JSON request is as follows :

```json
{
  "address": "ws://localhost:9001",
  "action": [
    {
      "action": "fibonacci",
      "type": "action_tester_if.action.Fibonacci"
    }
  ]
}
```
* address -the target gateway address to be allowed for the ROS action request
* action - an array of the action configuration to be exposed to the target
* action.action - the action name to be exposed to the target
* action.type - the action type to be exposed to the target

### ADD ROS-REST Mapping API

The ADD ROS-REST Mapping API configures the gateway to make REST request from ROS topics and send the created REST request to the target serivce uri.

The API URL is 'http://localhost:9000/gateway/rosrest/add'.

An example JSON request is as follows :

```json
{
  "service_name": "detect service",
  "service_uri": "http://localhost:9001/detect/",
  "service_method": "POST",
  "request_rule": {
    "content-type": "multipart/form-data",
    "topics": {
      "/image1": "sensor_msgs/msg/CompressedImage"
    },

* response_rule.mapping[].from - the member of the source field of the REST response 
* response_rule.mapping[].out - the target topics to be published
* response_rule.mapping[].to - a member of the target topics to be published


### Run gateway with config

An example JSON config example is as follows : myconfig.json
```
[
    {
        "title":"jackal1",
        "active": true,
        "address": "ws://192.168.0.15:9000",
        "publish": [
            {"name":"/kitti/camera_color_left/image_raw", "type":"sensor_msgs/msg/Image", "compression" : "cbor-raw"}
        ],
        "subscribe": [
            {"name":"/cmd_vel", "type":"geometry_msgs/msg/Twist"}
        ]
    }
]
```

Run command as follows :
```
ros2 launch rosextpy gateway_launch.xml file:=${PWD}/myconfig.json
```
